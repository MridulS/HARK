## Linking a fork to your local clone.

NOTE: Use this guide if you have clone HARK locally by doing `git clone https://github.com/econ-ark/HARK`.

If you want to submit the changes that you have done locally and the changes merged into the HARK repository you need add a link to your `fork` of the project so that you can create a pull request. A pull request is required to review your code and merge it with the HARK codebase.

1. Create a fork by navigating to https://github.com/econ-ark/HARK and click on `Fork` (top right corner). Select your username on GitHub under the account heading (if there is a pop-up).

2. Locally on your machine, navigate to the HARK directory.
```
$ cd /path/to/HARK
```

3. Check the current `remote` links of your local copy of HARK.

```
$ git remote -v
origin        https://github.com/econ-ark/HARK (fetch)
origin        https://github.com/econ-ark/HARK (push)
```
It should look something like this.

4. Add a new `remote` which adds link to your fork.

Change `user_name` to your `user_name` on GitHub.
```
$ git remote add user_name https://github.com/user_name/HARK
```

If we check the remote of this repository again it should link towards your fork too.

```
$ git remote -v
origin        https://github.com/econ-ark/HARK (fetch)
origin        https://github.com/econ-ark/HARK (push)
user_name    https://github.com/user_name/HARK (fetch)
user_name    https://github.com/user_name/HARK (push)
```

5. Now that you have a link to your fork you can start creating Pull Requests.

Add your local changes, assuming you made a change to the file `HARK/utilities.py` and `HARK/core.py`.

Add your changes to the staging area
```
$ git add HARK/utilities.py HARK/core.py
```

Commit your changes with a meaningful commit message.
```
$ git commit -m 'fixd bug #XXXX in core.py and utilites.py'
```

Push your changes to your `fork` on GitHub, `branch_name` is the current branch, by default it is `master`.
```
$ git push user_name branch_name
```

6. Navigating on GitHub will give you an option to create a Pull Request which will allow you to propose changes.
